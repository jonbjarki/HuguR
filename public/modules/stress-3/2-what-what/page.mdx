# What what what?


The Toolbox serves as your personalized repository for recording insights and strategies that you found beneficial within each unit. It's a dedicated space tailored for your personal notes and reflections on what resonated or proved helpful during the course modules.

Within the Toolbox, you can jot down key takeaways, practical tips, and techniques that particularly resonated with you. Which you can revisit and apply whenever needed.
